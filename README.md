## Evaluation

- 40% of the grading is based on **labs**: these will be typically performed in class hours, and will be handed in using e-gela. The student who hands-in approximately correct solutions to all assignments will be assigned full credit for this part. **Deadlines**: prior to next lab. The deadlines are tight.

- 20% of the grading is based on **assignments**: They are designed to be completed at home, and will be handed in using e-gela. The student whohands-in correct solutions on the given deadline to all assignments will be assigned full credit. **Deadlines**: 1&2 by end of Jan, 3&4 by end of Feb. The deadlines are more flexible, but later works will be penalized. No submission beyond 26th of March.

- 40% of the grading is based on a **final project**: Each student will propose a subject for the final project to one of the lecturers, depending on his/her interests. The final project will be graded based on an oral poster presentation and written report. See below for details.

## Final projects

**Content** of the project: The project will have two parts: 1) A summary of minimum one research paper on a topic of interest related to NLP and DL; 2) (Optionally) A practical programming project, where the student produces his/her own results linked to the topic of those two papers.

**Authorship**: Projects can be personal, but also done in collaboration between two students. The objectives need to be adjusted to account for the extra effort, and the grading will be also adjusted. For instance, there will be a minimun of two papers, which will need to be on the same topic, with the authors making a holistic analysis of both papers at the same time.

**Grading**: If the project does not include practical work, it can get at most half credit (that is 20% of the whole course). If the project includes practical work it can get full credit (full 40%). These are the components of the grading:

- technical 20%, including features like correctness and depth of the work
- presentation 10%, including clarity, structure, discussion
- write-up 10%, including features like clarity, structure, background, references, discussion

**Deadlines** for the final project (all deadlines are strict):

- Feb 6: project proposal and tutor proposal (i.e. which lecturer is to help you and judge your proposal) by EGELA
- Feb 20: individualized feedback from tutor
- Mar 17/18: poster sessions (also upload to EGELA)
- Mar 31: written report due by EGELA
- Apr 16: grade from tutors

**Project proposal**: Short document (less than one page is ok) with the following sections:

- title
- suggested tutor of the proposal (it will assigned by us trying to take into account the suggestion)
- description: which problem will you be investigating? Which are the two papers you selected?
- related work: other background for the problem (references to class material and/or additional papers and references)
- data: datasets, corpora used
- algorithm: architecture of the deep learning system(s)
  evaluation plan and results you expect

**Poster presentation**: We will be holding two poster presentation sessions (for the first time in our master!). In poster sessions attendants walk around a room where each presenter is standing close to his/her poster. Every time someone approaches the poster the presenter greets attendants and offers them an explanation, followed by some questions and answers. You will need to prepare a 3 min. speech presenting the highlights of your project based on the material shown in the poster, and be prepared to answer any question about the project.

- Please see sample presentation attached to this message (bottom of message).
- Poster needs to be printed in A1 size in portrait mode. The inexpensive printing company in the building accepts pdf's by email (ricoh.infor@gmail.com). Please mention to them that it is for the DL4NLP course by Eneko, and that they need to be printed it in 4 A3 sheets. You will need to stick them together on your own.

**Project write-up**:

- it consists of a short write-up from 3 to 6 pages (to be defined with the tutor)
- the write-up needs to follow the structure of a research paper in NLP or computational linguistics (e.g. similar to the project proposal, see also [example paper](https://aclanthology.org/K18-1017/))
- you need to use the following templates (latex or MS word or libreoffice): https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files/
